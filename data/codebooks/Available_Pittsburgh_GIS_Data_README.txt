This is a file explaining all of the GIS data that can be downloaded from the city of Pittsburgh's website:

http://pittsburghpa.gov/dcp/gis/gis-data

I have not uploaded any of it because it is extensive and perhaps not relevant to any particular task we plan on doing. 
However, it is a useful reference for finding data available from city GIS warehouses. 
Most major metropolitan areas probably have a similar online format for downloading spatial data.

I am particularly interested in the zoning information, which could indicate urban renewal and housing - 
  aspects of cities that presumably reverse shrinkage
