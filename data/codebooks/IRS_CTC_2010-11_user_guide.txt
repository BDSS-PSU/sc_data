OverviewThis documentation provides detailed information about the data content and the methods used to produce the IRS State-to-State Migration Data Flows Files and the IRS County-to-County Migration Data Flows Files.B. Definitions and ExplanationsB.1. Basic Data SourceThe IRS data extracts include records from the domestic tax Forms 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ as well as the foreign tax forms 1040NR, 1040PR, 1040VI and 1040SS.  The Census Bureau receives extracts through the 26th, 39th, and 52nd weeks in the IRS's processing year. We refer to these weeks as cycles. The data we use to produce the migration products are of data captured through Cycle 39 (which closes in late September).  Returns processed after that period are not included in these migration tabulations.  The cycle 39 extracts contain about 95 percent to 98 percent of all returns filed during any given tax year.  The IRS returns include the filer and the filer's spouse and all dependents via the exemptions category.  Title 13 and Title 26 confidentiality statutes protect the IRS data so individual taxpayers cannot be identified, either directly or indirectly from these tabulations.  These data released under these statutes are statistical summaries and have undergone suppression procedures to ensure no inappropriate disclosure of information.  Procedures are uniform across these data products and within products to ensure consistency so that inadvertent disclosures from complementary data tables do not occur.  There are two limitations of these data sources that deal with file coverage and population coverage.  First, the cycle 39 data do not represent the entire household population and any control counts shown in these tables will not match analogous control counts in other IRS statistical data products.  Second, there are segments of the population that are not as fully represented by tax returns, such as the elderly and those with limited incomes. Care should be exercised when using these data as proxies for other population universes.B.2. Reference PeriodThe tax returns are primarily filed and processed during the Spring following the end of the tax year.  This means that the bulk of the 1040 returns each tax year represent the residence of the filers during the time period that they filed.  When we refer to the data in files we mean the tax year.  When we refer to the migration year we mean the calendar year in which the returns were filed.  For example, the match of tax years 2009 and 2010 tax data produces 2010 to 2011 migration estimates.B.3. Assignment of Geographic CodesIn order to tabulate data for specific geographic areas, such as states and counties, each 1040 return is assigned a set of state and county FIPS codes that reflect the location of the filers’ address on the return. The Census Bureau's Geography Division (GEO) and Population Division (POP) prepare a ZIP+4-to-County-based Codebook to assign IRS address records to a state and county and to assign the correct FIPS codes.  The method combines U.S. Postal Service and the Census Bureau’s TIGER? files in order to assign (geo-code) the greatest number of IRS address records possible. The geo-coding process assigns state and county codes in all fifty states and the District of Columbia and identifies APO/FPO ZIP Codes and foreign entities.  The Codebook development process starts with a United States Postal Service (USPS) file that relates each ZIP+4 location to a state and county.  Geography Division cross checks the file against the TIGERTM system and updates any relationships with the FIPS codes. For the APO/FPO ZIP codes, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, Guam, American Samoa, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, staff makes specific changes and additions.  We match a state and county code from the Codebook to the nine-digit ZIP+4 on the mailing address of the Form 1040 returns (the returns carry the nine-digit ZIP+4 Code).  Each year, we code both the current year’s file and the prior year’s file using the current Codebook.B.4. Matching ReturnsTax returns are matched for two consecutive years.  The prior year is referred to as year-1 and the current year is referred to as year-2.  There are three categories of match status: (a) matched, (b) unmatched, year-1 return only, and (c) unmatched, year-2 return only.  The match is based on the SSN of the primary filer and no match is attempted for the secondary filer.1  Therefore, if a couple files a joint return in year-1 but files separate returns in year-2, then the spouse's year-2 return becomes a non-matching return while the primary filer remains matched.  An analogous situation occurs when two people file separate returns in year-1 and then jointly in year-2.B.5. Deceased FilersA deceased filer is identified by the abbreviation "DECD" in the primary filer name field and a deceased spouse of filer is similarly identified.  Separate flags are set for the filer's name field and the spouse of the filer depending on the circumstance.  The Census Bureau defines "estate" returns as single returns with the filer deceased and joint returns with both the filer and spouse deceased. These estate returns are excluded as exemptions in the data products.B.6. Zero Exemption ReturnsA person may file a return and still be claimed as an exemption on another person's return.  This happens when a tax filer is not allowed to claim his or her own personal exemption if he or she is claimed as an exemption on another person’s return.  Most of these cases are children who earned enough income to be required to file a return, but also are claimed as an exemption on their parents' return.  Responses to questions on the various 1040 forms identify these as "zero exemption" cases.  These returns are not tabulated as a return, or as an exemption in the migration or within the income data products.  However, the income from these returns is included in the aggregate income tables.B.7. Number of ExemptionsThe number of total exemptions for each return (usually referred to as the primary/secondary less deceased method) is defined as:(1) one for the primary filer if not deceased; plus (2) one for the secondary filer if present and not deceased; plus (3) the number of children exemptions at home, away and with Earned Income Credit; plus (4) the number of other exemptions.  The number of exemptions is defined from the year-2 returns for all matched returns and the year-2 only returns.  The number of exemptions for the year-1 only returns is, by necessity, derived from the year-1 return.B.8. Total Matched StatusThe total matched returns include: year-1 and year-2 matched returns (based on filer PIK), returns that are not "estate" or "zero exemption," and returns that are geocoded to a state or county in both years.  We also include any year-2 only return that is a 1040NR and coded to a state or county.  The matched returns are further classified into non-migrants, three classes of out-migrants and three classes of in-migrants.B.9. Non-Matched ReturnsRecords that do not match on the primary PIK between the year-1 file and the year-2 file are classified as non-matches.  These non-matches are referred to as year-1 only’s (there is a record in the year-1 file, but not in the year-2 file), and year-2 only’s (there is a record in the year-2 file, but not in the year-1 file).B.10. Mover StatusThe Census Bureau classifies all matched returns as movers or non-movers by comparing address information on matched tax returns between the two tax years.  A matched tax return is defined as a non-mover if the street address is the same between the two tax years, or if the state code, the ZIP Code and the post office name are identical in the two tax years.  Movers have a different address between the two tax years.The address reported on the tax return is a mailing address and may not always represent the residence address of the tax filer.  The following are the major reasons why the mailing address may not always be the same as the residence address.a. Tax preparers or accountants - some returns are filed directly by tax preparers and accountants from their address on behalf of the filer.b. Financial institutions - some financial institutions will give monetary loans to taxpayers based on their tax refund and later the financial institution will directly receive the refund instead of the filer.c. Business addresses - some taxpayers file their individual income tax returns directly to the IRS from their place of business.d. College students and military - some college students living at college or military living in barracks have their tax returns sent from the address of their parents or another address.e. Dual residences - some taxpayers maintain dual residences and live in each during different seasons.  As a result, a filer can live in one state while having their tax returns mailed to another state.f. Other addresses - for other reasons, the mailing address may not correspond with the residence address.  Some tax filers may, for instance, use a post office box as their mailing address.We assume that the mailing address of the tax return is the residence address.  Because of this assumption, some returns may be assigned an erroneous mover status.  For example, a change in mailing address without a change in residence address will lead a non-mover to be classified as a mover.  B.11. Migration StatusMigration status is determined when the year-1 state and county geographic codes are compared to the year-2 geographic codes.  A non-mover is, by definition a non-migrant, however a mover is not necessarily a migrant.  If a taxpayer moved but stayed within the same state and county then the mover is a "non-migrant."  If these geographic codes differ the mover is a "migrant."For tabulation purposes, the data cell "Year-1 only" includes the year-1 only non-matched returns and it also includes the matched returns that are coded to a state and county in year-1 but not coded to a state and county in year-2.  Likewise, the data cell "Year-2 only" includes the year-2 only non-matched returns, and it also includes the matched returns that are coded to a state and county in year-2 but not coded to a state or county in year-1.  It also excludes year-2 only non-matched returns that have a return type of "1040NR."B.12. Non-MigrantA matched return is classified as a "non-migrant" at the county level if the return is a non-mover, or if the year-1 state and county code is the same as the year-2 state and county code.  A matched return is classified as a "non-migrant" at the state level if the return is a non-mover, or if the year-1 state code is the same as the year-2 state code.B.13. MigrantA matched return is classified as a "migrant" at the county level if the return is a mover, and if the year-1 state and county code is different from the year-2 state and county code.  A matched return is classified as a "migrant" at the state level if the return is a mover, and if the year-1 state code is different from the year-2 state code. The migrants are tabulated twice in all the migration data products: as an out-migrant from the origin (year-1) state or county and as an in-migrant to the destination (year-2) state or county.  The total out-migration and the total in-migration are shown in all the migration data products.  In addition, sub-classifications of the migration are also shown.  B.14. Out-Migrant to Foreign CountriesA migrant is classified as an "out-migrant to foreign" if the year-1 state code is in the United States and the year-2 state code is foreign (APO/FPO, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, or other).B.15. Out-Migrant to Different StateA migrant is classified as an "out-migrant to different state" if the year-2 state code is in the United States, and the year-1 state code (also in the United States)and the year-2 state code differ.B.16. Out-Migrant to Same State, Different CountyA migrant is classified as an "out-migrant to same state, different county" if the year-2 state code is in the United States, and the year-1 state code and the year-2 state codes are the same, but the year-1 county code and the year-2 county code differ.  Note that this data cell is not defined for states, or for the county level equivalent of the District of Columbia.B.17. In-Migrant from Foreign CountriesA migrant is classified as an "in-migrant from foreign" if the year-1 state code is foreign (APO/FPO, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, or other) and the year-2 state code is in the United States, or if the return is a year-2 only 1040NR.B.18. In-Migrant from Different StateA migrant is classified as an "in-migrant from different state" if the year-1 state code is in the United States, and the year-1 state code and the year-2 state code (also in the United States) differ.B.19. In-Migrant from Same State, Different CountyA migrant is classified as an "in-migrant from same state, different county" if the year-1 state code is in the United States, and the year-1 state code and the year-2 state codes are the same, but the year-1 county code and the year-2 county code differ.  Note that this data cell is not defined for states, or for the county level equivalent of the District of Columbia.B.20. Income DataThe income amounts represent the taxable income amounts shown on the tax forms.  The amounts from the "estate" returns and the "zero exemption" returns are included in the tallies.  Aggregate income is the sum total of the income amounts from all applicable records.  Adjusted gross income includes the taxable income from all sources, less the adjustments to income, such as IRS deduction, self-employment tax and health insurance, alimony paid, etc.  (See line 37 on the form 1040).C.  Data Suppression ProceduresIn order to protect the confidentiality of information of individual taxpayers, data cells that are based on a small number of returns will not be shown.  At the state level, the cell must be based on at least three returns to be shown while at the county level, cells must be based on at least ten returns to be shown.  All other data cells will be suppressed.  The suppression procedures are designed to maintain additivity across and within geographic levels, and comparability across data products.A variety of suppression methods are used.  The data cell may be suppressed by replacing the data with "d."  The data may be suppressed by adding the value into another data cell, and replacing the value with “d.”  The data cell may be suppressed by adding the value into the value for another piece of geography, and replacing the value with "d."  Data cells may be suppressed by accumulating the data into higher-level geographic levels, and not showing the lowest geographic level. In addition to the direct suppression of selected data cells, complementary suppression of other data cells may be done to prevent the re-derivation of suppressed data from the totals or from other data products.  Complementary suppression may be done across data cells or across geography.C.1. Suppression Procedures for the State-to-State Migration FlowsNote:  In the text below, “X1, X2, Y1, and Y2” represent individual states; “FR” represents a foreign country.)C.1.a. Suppression process for In-migrants:If the number of returns in the flow has less than three returns, then the flow is suppressed by replacing the value with "d."If the flow is between states, then complementary suppression is made to three other flows, where the value for the suppressed flow is replaced with "d." If (X1-to-X2) is the suppressed flow, then another flow (Y1-to-Y2) is chosen for complementary suppression, where Y1 is in the same region as X1 and Y2 is in the same region as X2.  The other two flows requiring complementary suppression are then (X1-to-Y2) and (X2-to-Y1).  This same suppression will be carried forward into the county-to-county flow suppression process.If the flow is between a foreign country and a state in the United States, then complementary suppression is made to another foreign-state flow, where the value for the suppressed flow is replaced with "d."  If (FR-to-X2) is the suppressed flow, then another flow (FR-to-Y2) is chosen for complementary suppression, where Y2 is in the same region as X2.  This same suppression will be carried forward into the county-to-county flow suppression process.C.1.b. Suppression process for out-migrants:If the number of returns in the flow has less than three returns, then the flow is suppressed by replacing the value with "d.” If the flow is between states in the United States, then complementary suppression is made to three other flows, where the value for the suppressed flow is replaced with "d." If (X1-to-X2) is the suppressed flow, then another flow (Y1-to-Y2) is chosen for complementary suppression, where Y1 is in the same region as X1 and Y2 is in the same region as X2.  The other two flows requiring complementary suppression are then (X1-to-Y2) and (X2-to-Y1).  This same suppression will be carried forward into the county-to-county flow suppression process.If the flow is between a state in the United States and a foreign country, then complementary suppression is made to another state-foreign flow, where the value for the suppressed flow is replaced with "d."  If (X1-to-FR) is the suppressed flow, then another flow (Y1-to-FR) is chosen for complementary suppression, where Y1 is in the same region as X1. This same suppression will be carried forward into the county-to-county flow suppression process.C.2. Suppression Procedures for the County-to-County Migration FlowsC.2.a. Suppression process for Out-migrants:If the total number of returns for the county is less than ten, then all data for the county will be suppressed by adding it into the data for another county.  If there is a state-to-state flow requiring suppression on the state-to-state migration flow table, then the suppression and complementary suppressions required are done for all counties in the state in the county-to-county flow data. If there is a state-to-foreign flow requiring suppression on the state-to-state migration flow table, then the suppression and complementary suppressions required are done for all counties in the state in the county-to-county flow data.If the total number of migrants for all flows is less than ten, the total number of migrants for all flows in the United States is less than ten, the total number of non-migrants is less than ten, or the number of year-2 onlys is less than ten returns, then all data for the county will be suppressed.  For consistency with the migration total processing, the data will be replaced with "d."After we check the totals, we next check the migration summaries for all out-migrants from a county.  If the number of out-migrants to a foreign country is less than ten, then it will be suppressed by adding it into the number of out-migrants to a different state.  All individual out-flows to foreign countries are also suppressed.If the number of out-migrants to a different state is less than ten, or the number of out-migrants to a different county in the same state is less than ten, then all out-migration data for the county is suppressed.If there is one and only one county in the state where the migration summary data are suppressed, then another county in the state is chosen for complementary suppression.  All out-migration data for that county is then suppressed.  If the county flow totals are suppressed (above), then the individual out-flow data are also suppressed.  For the other counties where the county flow totals are shown, then individual county-to-county flow data may be shown, subject to the suppressions listed below.All individual county-to-county flows with less than ten returns are suppressed by combining them into six subtotal categories: foreign, same state, different state-Northeast region, different state-Midwest region, different state-South region, and different state-West region.  If any of the four region subtotals have less than ten returns, then the four region subtotals are collapsed into one subtotal category, termed "different state."If the number of returns in the "foreign" subtotal is less than ten, then an individual out-migration flow to foreign with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "foreign" subtotal.If the number of returns in the "same state" subtotal is less than ten, then an individual out-migration flow to a county in the same state with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "same state" subtotal.If the number of returns in the "different state" subtotal is less than ten, then an individual out-migration flow to a county in a different state with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "different state" subtotal.C.2.b. Suppression process for in-migrants:If the total number of returns for the county is less than ten, then all data for the county will be suppressed by adding it into the data for another county.  If there is a state-to-state flow requiring suppression on the state-to-state migration flow table, then the suppression and complementary suppressions required are done for all counties in the state in the county-to-county flow data.If there is a foreign-to-state flow requiring suppression on the state-to-state migration flow table, then the suppression and complementary suppressions required are done for all counties in the state in the county-to-county flow data.If the total number of migrants for all flows is less than ten, the total number of migrants for all flows in the United States is less than ten, the total number of non-migrants is less than ten, or the number of year-2 only returns is less than ten, then all data for the county will be suppressed.  For consistency with the migration total processing, the data will be replaced with "d."The migration summaries for all in-migrants to a county are checked next.If the number of in-migrants from foreign is less than ten, then it will be suppressed by adding it into the number of in-migrants from a different state.  All individual in-flows from foreign are also suppressed.If the number of in-migrants from a different state is less than ten, or the number of in-migrants from a different county in the same state is less than ten, then all in-migration data for the county is suppressed.If there is one and only one county in the state where the migration summary data are suppressed, then another county in the state is chosen for complementary suppression.  All in-migration data for that county is then suppressed.  If the county flow totals are suppressed, then the individual in-flow data are also suppressed.  For the other counties where the county flow totals are shown, then individual county-to-county flow data may be shown, subject to the suppressions listed below.All individual county-to-county flows with less than ten returns are suppressed by combining them into six subtotal categories: foreign, same state, different state-Northeast region, different state-Midwest region, different state-South region, and different state-West region.  If any of the four region subtotals have less than ten returns, then the four region subtotals are collapsed into one subtotal category, termed "different state."If the number of returns in the "foreign" subtotal is less than ten, individual in-migration flow from foreign countries with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "foreign" subtotal.If the number of returns in the "same state" subtotal is less than ten, then an individual in-migration flow to a county in the same state with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "same state" subtotal.If the number of returns in the "different state" subtotal is less than ten, then an individual in-migration flow to a county in a different state with ten or more returns is suppressed by adding it into the "different state" subtotal.D. Geographic Codes ListA complete list of U.S., Region and Division Codes, and the State and County Federal Information Processing System (FIPS) Codes are located at: http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/codes.htmlThe FIPS coding system has been superseded by the American National Standards Institute Codes or ANSI code system.  However, the State and County codes are unchanged.
