This is data on several different types of crime from the FBI. See the field names for a list of
all of the specific crimes that were measured.

Most importantly, this data is not well-formatted. While it is separated by MSA, each MSA is divided into
cities, "total area reporting," and "rate per 100,000 inhabitants." So some column values contain
counts, and some contain rates. The rate per 100,000 inhabitants is the only one that enables comparison. 

However, these important notes are included at the bottom of each year's data, especially note #4:

1 Although arson data are included in the trend and clearance tables, sufficient data are not available to estimate totals for this offense.
2 Violent crimes are offenses of murder, forcible rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.
3 Property crimes are offenses of burglary, larceny-theft, and motor vehicle theft.  Data are not included for the property crime of arson.
4 Due to changes in reporting practices, annexations, and/or incomplete data, figures are not comparable to previous years' data.
5 Forcible rape figures furnished by the state Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program administered by the Delaware State Bureau of Investigation were not in accordance with national UCR guidelines; 
 therefore, the figures were excluded from the forcible rape, Crime Index total, and Modified Crime Index total categories. 
6 Forcible rape figures furnished by the state Uniform Crime Reporting Program administered by the Minnestoa Department of Public Safety are not comparable to those for previous years.
7 The population for the city of Mobile, Alabama, includes 40,228 inhabitants from the jurisdiction of the Mobile County Sheriff's Department.
  Dashes (-) indicate a zero report.

So this data is best used as contextual, rather than quantifiable and comparable.

Each year between 1999 and 2013 is contained in a different file because of shifting numbers of MSAs, which makes joining difficult.
