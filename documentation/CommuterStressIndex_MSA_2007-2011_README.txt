Commuter Stress Index is defined as the percent added time it takes
to get to home or work (peak direction of travel) during the most congested
parts of the day. It is a percent of normal commute time. 

So a value of 1.26 means that a normal commute time of 20 minutes would
take 26 minutes during peak travel time.
