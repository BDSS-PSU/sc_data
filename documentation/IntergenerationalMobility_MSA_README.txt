Intergenerational Mobility is defined as the economic and social ability of children in "low
income households to work their way into the middle class and above." (The Atlantic, Nov 19 2014 - 
"Why It's So Hard for Millennials to Find a Place to Live and Work")

Here is the definition from the data on Relative and Absolute Mobility:

This table presents mobility estimates by Metropolitan Statistical Area (CBSA codes) 
for the core sample. Number of children is the number of children in the MSA used to estimate the
 mobility statistics. Relative mobility (RM) is the slope from OLS regression of child rank on parent 
rank within each MSA in core sample using baseline income definitions. Relative mobility can be 
multiplied by the difference in parent ranks (on a 0-100 scale) to obtain the expected difference 
in child's rank (on a 0-100 scale).   Absolute upward mobility (AM) is the expected rank of children 
whose parents are at the 25th percentile of the national income distribution.  Expected ranks at other 
percentiles P between 0 and 100 can be computed as AM+(P-25)*RM. 

This data cannot really be considered a yearly measure. It takes family economic factors dating back to
1980 into account to consider upward and downward changes for the millenial generation. Therefore, this dataset 
should be used to represent a profile of the MSA, rather than a yearly value.

This data can be joined to the other data via the MSA ID, which is the same as the CBSA ID.
